### DESCRIPTION
This page was created to allow a person to order a pizza and then find out how much that pizza would cost with different toppings and bases. This resource has great examples of spacing, indentation, if/else statements as well as a few for loops. More importantly it uses constructors and prototypes to look through objects.
